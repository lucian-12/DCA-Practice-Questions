### **Answer 1: b**

*Explanation*

The manager node also generates two tokens to use when you join
additional nodes to the swarm: one worker token and one manager token.
Each token includes the digest of the root CA's certificate and a
randomly generated secret. When a node joins the swarm, the joining node
uses the digest to validate the root CA certificate from the remote
manager. The remote manager uses the secret to ensure the joining node
is an approved node.

Each time a new node joins the swarm, the manager issues a certificate
to the node. The certificate contains a randomly generated node ID to
identify the node under the certificate common name (CN) and the role
under the organizational unit (OU). The node ID serves as the
cryptographically secure node identity for the lifetime of the node in
the current swarm.

The diagram below illustrates how manager nodes and worker nodes encrypt
communications using a minimum of TLS 1.2.
